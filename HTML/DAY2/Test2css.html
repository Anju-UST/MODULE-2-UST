                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Minima mollitia fuga optio inventore nulla dicta beatae? Nulla distinctio ex doloremque aspernatur harum omnis molestias quasi, doloribus pariatur ut quos nihil.Its something thats often in the top fears of people. Nobody wants to talk or even think about it. The subject has the power to take our breath away, paralyzing our thoughts. Im talking about death. 
                    Whether you choose to think about it or not, you and those you love will die someday. I dont say that to be morbid, but rather because acknowledging and talking about it actually makes death a little easier. Thats because knowing what to expect helps you not be so blindsided when it finally comes for you.
                    
                    BJ Miller and Soshana Bergers A Beginners Guide to the End: Practical Advice for Living Life and Facing Death contains the advice you need to prepare for death. Although it may sound intimidating to think about death, I promise that doing so will help you live a better life.</p>

                <p>All four of my grandparents had cancer at some point. About 10 years ago my dad got it, too. Receiving the news really shook me up. I had to take the time to process what was happening so I could function properly. It’s a gut-wrenching event that most can’t get a grasp on at first. You’re not a bad person for needing time to take it all in and stabilize yourself. 

                    When I got the news about my dad, I was halfway across the world. I remember going to the beach and walking along the shore of the Isle of Man where I lived at the time, just thinking. After learning of a terminal illness, it’s best to take some time to relax somewhere that you feel the safest and comfortable.</p>

                <p>When you die, you’ll take nothing with you. So clean up after yourself to not leave so much for your family to take care of after you’re gone. Give your relatives the gift of being able to focus solely on you after you go, instead of having to clean out your attic. 

                    It also helps your loved ones to leave behind meaningful items, like a letter for them to read in the future. Also, throw away the junk. Only leave what you want to pass down. 
                    
                    When one of my grandma’s had terminal cancer she would put a piece of tape on items and write the name of the person to whom she wanted it to go. That made things a lot easier for all of us after she was gone.</p>

                <p>My dad and his parents all survived cancer. My other two grandparents weren’t so lucky. My mom’s dad succumbed to his illness before I was born, but I still remember when her mom died. It was shockingly painful. The best thing to do for me is what anyone should do after a loved one dies-focus on gentle self-care. 

                    You can and must take time to grieve. It’s okay to cry, get angry, or do whatever your feelings dictate. Think of it like letting a wave washing over you. My mom once told me that when my grandpa died all of her siblings handled it differently. One punched a hole in the wall. Another held it all in until watching the Lion King and then cried like a baby. You do what works best for you, and don’t be afraid of emotion.</p>
